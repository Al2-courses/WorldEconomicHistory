## 📘 Course Description

This course introduces students to the study of **world economic history**, a discipline that examines the evolution of economies, institutions, and societies through both data and narrative. It emphasizes how **past choices** and **chance events** have shaped the present, drawing on **empirical data**, **comparative analysis**, and **interpretive frameworks**.

Students will explore major themes including:

- The Industrial Revolution  
- Comparative development  
- Inequality  
- The historical roots of globalization  

This course is distinct from *History of Economic Ideas*: whereas that course focuses on **theories and thinkers**, *World Economic History* centers on **facts, processes, institutions**, and **long-term trajectories**.  

By engaging with both **quantitative evidence** and **historical interpretation**, students will learn how the past informs present economic realities and develop skills in comparative and critical analysis.
